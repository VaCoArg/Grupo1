</head>
     <div>
         <p>
            I Left <placeName>Buenos Ayres</placeName>, and took the Road I to <placeName>Cordoua</placeName>, leaving <placeName>Santa Fe</placeName> on 
            my right hand, of which place take this account, 'tis a Spanish Settlement 
            dependant upon <placeName>Buenos Ayres</placeName>, the Commander is no more than a Lieutenant, 
            and does nothing but by order from the Governor of <placeName>Buenos Ayres</placeName>. 'Tis a 
            little place containing 25 Houses, without any Walls, Fortifications, or 
            Garrison, distant 80 Leagues from <placeName>Buenos Ayres</placeName> Northward, Situate upon the 
            <placeName>River de la Plata</placeName>, large Vessels might come up to it, were it not for a 
            great bank that obstructs the passage a little above Buenos Ayres. 
            Nevertheless 'tis a very advantageous Post, because 'tis the only passage 
            from <placeName>Peru</placeName>, <placeName>Chili</placeName> and <placeName>Tucuman</placeName> to <placeName>Paraguay</placeName>, and in a manner the Magazine of 
            the Commodi<fw type="catch">ties</fw>
            <pb n="25"/>
            ties drawn from thence, particularly that Herb already spoken 
            of, which they cannot be without in those Provinces. 
            The Soil is as good and Fertile here as at <placeName>Buenos Ayres</placeName>; and the Town having nothing 
            remarkably different from what has been observ'd of <placeName>Buenos Ayres</placeName>, I leave 
            it, and proceed upon my Journey. 'Tis counted 140 Leagues from <placeName>Buenos 
            Ayres</placeName> to <placeName>Cordoua</placeName>, and because some parts of the Road are uninhabited for a 
            long way together; I surnished my self at my departure with what I was 
            inform'd I should stand in need of; so I set out having a Savage for my 
            Guide, with Three Horses and Three Mules, some to carry my Baggage, and 
            the rest to change upon the way when that I rid upon was tired.
         </p>
         <p>
            From <placeName>Buenos Ayres</placeName>, to the <placeName>River Lucan</placeName>, and even as far as the <placeName>River 
            Recife</placeName>, 30 Leagues, I pass’d by several Habitations and Farms cultivated 
            by the Spaniards, but beyond <placeName>Recife</placeName> to the <placeName>River Salladillo</placeName>, I saw none. 
            Let it be observed by the way, that these Rivers as well as all the rest 
            in the Provinces of <placeName>Buenos Ayres</placeName>, <placeName>Paraguay</placeName> and <placeName>Tucuman</placeName>, that fall into the 
            River de la Plata are fordable on Horse-back; but when the Rains or any 
            other accident swells them, a Traveller must either swim over, or else get 
            upon a bundle in the nature of a raft, which a Savage hawls over to the 
            other side. I could not Swim, and so was forc'd to make use of this 
            expedient twice or thrice when I could not find a Ford. The way was this, 
            my Indian kill'd a Wild Bull, flead the Hide off, stuffed it with straw, 
            and ty'd it up in a great bundle with thongs of the same Hide, upon which 
            I plac'd my self with my Baggage ; he swam over hawling me after him by a 
            Cord ty'd to the bundle, and then he repass'd and swam my Horses and Mules 
            over to me.
         </p>
         <p>
            All the Country between the <placeName>River Recife</placeName> and <placeName>Salladillo</placeName>, tho' uninhabited, 
            abounds in Cattle and all sorts of Fruit trees, except Walnut and Chesnut-
            trees; there are whole Woods of Nectarine-Trees, Three or Four Leagues in 
            compass, that bear excellent Fruit, which they not only eat raw, but bake 
            them, or dry them in the Sun, to keep, as we in France do Prunes: They 
            seldom use any other than the Wood of this Tree for common firing at 
            Buenos Ayres, and thereabouts. The Savages that dwell in these Parts are 
            distinguish'd into two sorts, those that voluntarily submit to the 
            Spaniards are call’d Panpistas, the rest Serranos, both cloathed with 
            Skins, but the last set up on the Panpistas as their mortal Enemies 
            wherever they meet with them. All Fight on Horse-back, either with Lances 
            pointed with Iron or Bones sharpen'd, or else with Bows and Arrows, they 
            wear Bulls-hides fashion'd like a Doublet without sleeves, to defend their 
            Bodies. Their Chiefs that command over them in War and Peace, are call’d 
            Couracas. When they take any one of their Enemies, alive or dead, they 
            meet all together, and after they have reproach'd him, that either he or 
            his Relations were the death of their Kindred or Friends, they cut and 
            tear him into pieces, which they roast a little and eat, making a drinking 
            Bowl of his Scull. They feed mostly upon flesh either raw or dress'd, and 
            particularly Colts flesh, which they like! better than Veal. They catch 
            abundance of Fish likewise in their Rivers, They have no settled places of 
            aboad, but ramble up and down, several Families together, and live in Tents.
         </p>
         <p>
            I could not inform my self exactly what Religion they were of, but I was 
            told that they look'd upon the Sun and Moon as Deities and as I travell'd 
            along, I saw a Savage upon his knees with his Face to the Sun, who cry'd 
            out and made strange gestures with his Hands and Arms. I learn'd from the 
            Savage that accompany'd me, that he was one of those they call'd Papas, 
            who in the Morning kneel towards the Sun, and at Night towards the Moon, 
            to supplicate those fancy'd Divinities to be propitious to them, to give 
            them fair Weather, and Victory over their Foes.
         </p>
         <p>
            They make no great Ceremony in their Marriages ; but when a Relation dies, 
            after they have rubb’d his body with a certain Earth that consumes all but 
            the Bones, they preserve them, and carry as many of them as they can 
            conveniently about with them in a sort of Chests, and this they do in 
            token of their affection to their Kindred ; indeed they are not wanting in 
            good Offices to them during their Lives, nor in their Sickness and Death.
         </p>
         <p>
            Along the River <placeName>Salladillo</placeName>, I took notice of a great many Parrats, or 
            Papagays, as the Spaniards call them, and certain Birds, call’d 
            Guacamayos, which are of divers Colours, and twice or thrice as big as a 
            Parrat. The River it self is full of the Fish, call'd Dorado, which is 
            very good to eat. There is also a Creature in it, whether 'tis Meat or 
            Poyson no body knows, it has Four Feet and a long Tail like a Lizard.
         </p>
         <p>
            From <placeName>Salladillo</placeName> quite to <placeName>Cordoua</placeName>, you go along a very fine River, that 
            abounds with Fish, which is neither wide nor deep, for it may be forded 
            over. On the Bank of it you meet with little Plan tations every Three or 
            Four Leagues ; which are like Country Houses inhabited by Spaniards, 
            Portuguese, and the Natives, who have all the necessary accomodations of 
            Life they can wish, and are very Civil and Charitable to Strangers; their 
            principal Wealth is in Horses and Mules, in which they Trade with the 
            Inhabitants of Peru.
         </p>
         <p>
            <placeName>Cordoua</placeName> is a Town Situate in a pleasant and fruitful Plain upon the side 
            of a River, bigger and broader than that I have just spoken of : 'Tis 
            compos’d of about 400 Houses, Built like those of <placeName>Buenos Ayres</placeName>. It has 
            neither Ditches, nor Walls, nor Fort for its defence; He that Commands it 
            is Governor of all the Provinces of <placeName>Tucuman</placeName>, and tho’ it be the place of 
            his ordinary Residence, yet he is wont now and then, as he sees occasion, 
            to go and pass some time at <placeName>St. Jago de l’Estro</placeName>, at <placeName>St. Miguel de Tucuman</placeName>, 
            (which is the Capital City of the Province) at <placeName>Salta</placeName> and at <placeName>Xuxui</placeName>. In each 
            of these Villages there is a Lieutenant, who has under him an Alcalde and 
            some Officers for the Administration of Justice. The Bishop of <placeName>Tucuman</placeName> 
            likewise usually resides at <placeName>Cordoua</placeName>, where the Cathedral is the only 
            Parish Church of the whole Town, but there are divers Convents of Monks, 
            namely of Dominicans, Recollects, and those of the Order de la Mercy: and 
            one of Nunns. The Jesuits have a College there, and their Chappel is the 
            finest and richest of all.
         </p>
         <p>
            The Inhabitants are Rich in Gold and Silver, which they get by the Trade 
            they have for Mules, with which they furnish <placeName>Peru</placeName> and other Parts; which 
            is so considerable, that they sell about 28 or 30000 of 'em every Year, 
            which they breed up in their Farms. They usually keep 'em till they are 
            about Two Years old, then expose 'em to Sale, and have about Six Patagons 
            a piece for 'em. The Merchants that come to buy 'em, carry 'em to <placeName>St. 
            Jago</placeName>, to <placeName>Salta</placeName> and <placeName>Xuxui</placeName> , where they leave 'em for Three Years, till they 
            are well grown and become strong, and afterwards bring 'em to <placeName>Peru</placeName>, where 
            they presently have Vent for 'em, because there as well as in the rest of 
            the Western part of <placeName>America</placeName>, the greatest part of their Carriage is upon 
            Mules. The People of <placeName>Cordoua</placeName> also drive a Trade in Cows, which they have 
            from the Countrey of <placeName>Buenos Ayres</placeName>, and carry to <placeName>Peru</placeName>, where without this 
            way of Subsistance 'tis certain they would have much ado to live. This 
            kind of Traffick makes this Town the most considerable in the Province of 
            <placeName>Tucuman</placeName>, as well for its Riches and Commodities, as for the Number of its 
            Inhabitants, which are counted to be at least 5 or 600 Families, besides 
            Slaves who are three times the number. But the gene rality of 'em of all 
            degrees have no other Arms but a Sword and Poignard, and are very 
            indifferent Souldiers, the Air of the Country, and the Plenty they enjoy, 
            rendring them Lazy and Cowardly.
