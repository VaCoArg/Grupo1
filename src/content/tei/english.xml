          <p>
I Left <placeName>Buenos Ayres</placeName>, and took the Road I to <placeName>Cordoua</placeName>, leaving <placeName>Santa Fe</placeName> on 
my right hand, of which place take this account, 'tis a Spanish Settlement 
dependant upon Buenos Ayres, the Commander is no more than a Lieutenant, 
and does nothing but by order from the Governor of Buenos Ayres. 'Tis a 
little place containing 25 Houses, without any Walls, Fortifications, or 
Garrison, distant 80 Leagues from <placeName>Buenos Ayres</placeName> Northward, Situate upon the 
<placeName>River de la Plata</placeName>, large Vessels might come up to it, were it not for a 
great bank that obstructs the passage a little above <placeName>Buenos Ayres</placeName>. 
Nevertheless 'tis a very advantageous Post, because 'tis the only passage 
from <placeName>Peru</placeName>, <placeName>Chili</placeName> and <placeName>Tucuman</placeName> to <placeName>Paraguay</placeName>, and in a manner the Magazine of 
the Commodities drawn from thence, particularly that Herb already spoken 
of, which they cannot be without in those Provinces.
