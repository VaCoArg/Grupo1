         I Left Buenos Ayres, and took the Road I to Cordoua, leaving Santa Fe on 
         my right hand, of which place take this account, 'tis a Spanish Settlement 
         dependant upon Buenos Ayres, the Commander is no more than a Lieutenant, 
         and does nothing but by order from the Governor of Buenos Ayres. 'Tis a 
         little place containing 25 Houses, without any Walls, Fortifications, or 
         Garrison, distant 80 Leagues from Buenos Ayres Northward, Situate upon the 
         River de la Plata, large Vessels might come up to it, were it not for a 
         great bank that obstructs the passage a little above Buenos Ayres. 
         Nevertheless 'tis a very advantageous Post, because 'tis the only passage 
         from Peru, Chili and Tucuman to Paraguay, and in a manner the Magazine of 
         the Commodities drawn from thence, particularly that Herb already spoken 
         of, which they cannot be without in those Provinces.
