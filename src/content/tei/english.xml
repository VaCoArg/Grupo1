         <p>
         I Left <placeName>Buenos Ayres</placeName>, and took the Road I to <placeName>Cordoua</placeName>, leaving <placeName>Santa Fe</placeName> on 
         my right hand, of which place take this account, 'tis a Spanish Settlement 
         dependant upon <placeName>Buenos Ayres</placeName>, the Commander is no more than a Lieutenant, 
         and does nothing but by order from the Governor of <placeName>Buenos Ayres</placeName>. 'Tis a 
         little place containing 25 Houses, without any Walls, Fortifications, or 
         Garrison, distant 80 Leagues from <placeName>Buenos Ayres</placeName> Northward, Situate upon the 
        <placeName>River de la Plata</placeName>, large Vessels might come up to it, were it not for a 
         great bank that obstructs the passage a little above Buenos Ayres. 
         Nevertheless 'tis a very advantageous Post, because 'tis the only passage 
         from <placeName>Peru</placeName>, <placeName>Chili</placeName> and <placeName>Tucuman</placeName> to <placeName>Paraguay</placeName>, and in a manner the Magazine of 
         the Commodities drawn from thence, particularly that Herb already spoken 
         of, which they cannot be without in those Provinces.
