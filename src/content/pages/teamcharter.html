<h2>Team Members</h2>
<ul> 
    <li>Technical leader: Valeria Colella</li>
    <li>Submitter / Encargada de envíos: Ana Virginia Lona</li>

<h2>Goals / Objetivos</h2>
<p>As a team, we want to improve our programming skills with Visual Studio and Github and use those skills to create a digital-humanities project together. 
    That will mean learning how to communicate well as a group, by finding ways to collaborate across continents and languages and given our differing areas of expertise. 
    Part of that work will be recognizing each of our strengths, while also learning from one another and exploring parts of programming and digital-humanities research that we are less familiar with. 
    We hope that the edition we create will be a useful resource for researchers and will make historical research more generally accessible.
</p>

<h2>Core Values</h2>
<p>We will achieve our objectives by communicating and coordinating the different activities among the members of the group. 
    We have great expectations for expanding our knowledge of Digital Humanities through this course. 
    To maintain accountability, the team leader will assign each member of the group a role and a deadline so that everyone has time to get their work done. 
    We do not consider our different languages ​​an impediment but rather an opportunity to learn.
