<h2>Team Members</h2>
<ul>
    <li> Valeria Colella (she), Córdoba (ARG), Technical leader </li>
    <li> Joaquín Cerrutti (he), Buenos Aires (ARG), data controller   </li>
    <li> Sam DiBella (he), Maryland (US), English translator and proofreader</li>
    <li> Ana Virginia Lona (she), Córdoba, (ARG), submitter. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Goals </h2>
<p>As a team, we want to improve our programming skills with Visual Studio and Github and use those skills to create a digital-humanities project together. That will mean learning how to communicate well as a group, by finding ways to collaborate across continents and languages and given our differing areas of expertise. Part of that work will be recognizing each of our strengths, while also learning from one another and exploring parts of programming and digital-humanities research that we are less familiar with. We hope that the edition we create will be a useful resource for researchers and will make historical research more generally accessible.</p>
 
<h2>Core Values</h2>
<p>We will achieve our objectives by communicating and coordinating the different activities among the members of the group. We have great expectations for expanding our knowledge of Digital Humanities through this course. To maintain accountability, the team leader will assign each member of the group a role and a deadline so that everyone has time to get their work done. We do not consider our different languages ​​an impediment but rather an opportunity to learn.</p>

<h2>Team management </h2>
<p>Through this document, this team agrees to manage its work according to the following commitments:</br>
1. We agree that each member of this team can always share their ideas, without fear or embarrassment. All ideas will be discussed together and will have the same value, without hierarchies or ranks.</br>
2. We commit to always communicating, to do our best to attend the weekly virtual meetings and to answer all requests that any other member may make via our agreed forms of communication: Slack, WhatsApp and email.</br>
3. We agree that, in case of internal conflicts, we will seek a solution based on tolerance and mutual respect, externalizing the problem only if we cannot solve it within the team.</br>
4. We agree that all team members will receive equal credit for the project. We will perform different tasks, but we are one team, and therefore the final product will be the responsibility of each and every one of us. Likewise, the final product cannot be attributed to any individual member.</br>
5. We commit to making our digital humanities project open source and Creative Commons licensed.</br>
6. We commit to striving to learn all the skills that make this project possible and that occur within the framework of this course and to take advantage of all learning opportunities.</p>

<h2>Ethos</h2>
<p>* We seek group consensus for each stage of the learning process.</br>
* We enjoy the linguistic and technical challenges of the collaborative learning process.</br>
* We encourage practicing each skill we learn in order to strengthen it.</p>
