    <h1>Sam DiBella ðŸŒ±</h1>
    <p>I'm a 2nd-year PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park, at the College of Information Studies. My main research interests are privacy and surveillance technologies, 
        but I used to work as an academic editor for SpringerNature. I enjoy publishing work both for the material use of information sharing, but also for the community and shared
        purpose that it can create.</p>
    <p>I have more information about my writing and research on <a href="https://samueldibella.github.io"/>my personal website</a>.</p>
