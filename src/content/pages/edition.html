  <h1>Our Edition</h1>

  <p>
    This is a digital scholarly edition of an excerpt from "Monsieur Acarete du Biscayâ€™s Journey from Buenos Ayres to Peru," in both Spanish and English. We have focused our editorial changes on updating names and spellings to contemporary Spanish and English, intending to make the original text slightly more accessible to our readers. We've used CSS styling to mark different kinds of those changes, so that it is possible in almost all cases to visually identify what kind of correction has been made to each word.
