  <h1>Our Edition</h1>

  <p>
    This is a digital scholarly edition of an excerpt from “Monsieur Acarete du Biscay’s Journey from Buenos Ayres to Peru,” in both Spanish and English. The original Spanish text provides du Biscay’s account of his travels, intended to provide military information to the Spanish government. His writing was later translated into English and circulated as literary travel writing.

    Our edition draws its texts from a 1867 Spanish edition and a 1698 English edition. Since the English edition is itself a historical document, we felt it important to encode some textual features like page breaks and catchwords with Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) tags. We have focused our editorial changes on updating names and spellings to contemporary Spanish and English, intending to make the text more accessible to readers.

    Editorial corrections are marked by a TEI tag in the site HTML. Given the text’s original use of providing government intelligence, we thought it was important to tag numbers as well since they are often used to make observations of distance and population. We have also used TEI tagging with corresponding CSS styling to mark different names and social features of the text. The key for those styles is as follows: 
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #dc3522;">Red type, small caps</span>: social roles</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #dc3522;">Red type, bold</span>: place names</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: 300;
        font-style: italic; color: #dc3522;">Red type, italic</span>: social group names</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: 600; ">Black type, bold</span>: <i>sic</i>, indicating the spelling of a word is not a typo, but rather the original spelling of the printed edition</li>
    </ul>
