'Tis a \n            little place containing 25 Houses, without any Walls, Fortifications, or \n            Garrison, distant 80 Leagues from <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Buenos Ayres</tei-placeName> Northward, Situate upon the \n            <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">River de la Plata</tei-placeName>, large Vessels might come up to it, were it not for a \n            great bank that obstructs the passage a little above Buenos Ayres. \n            Nevertheless 'tis a very advantageous Post, because 'tis the only passage \n            from <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Peru</tei-placeName>, <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Chili</tei-placeName> and <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Tucuman</tei-placeName> to <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Paraguay</tei-placeName>, and in a manner the Magazine of \n            the Commodi<tei-fw type=\"catch\" data-origname=\"fw\" data-origatts=\"type\">ties</tei-fw>\n            <tei-pb n=\"25\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n            ties drawn from thence, particularly that Herb already spoken \n            of, which they cannot be without in those Provinces. \n            The Soil is as good and Fertile here as at <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Buenos Ayres</tei-placeName>; and the Town having nothing \n            remarkably different from what has been observ'd of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Buenos Ayres</tei-placeName>, I leave \n            it, and proceed upon my Journey. 'Tis counted 140 Leagues from <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Buenos \n            Ayres</tei-placeName> to <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Cordoua</tei-placeName>, and because some parts of the Road are uninhabited for a \n            long way together; I surnished my self at my departure with what I was \n            inform'd I should stand in need of; so I set out having a Savage for my \n            Guide, with Three Horses and Three Mules, some to carry my Baggage, and \n            the rest to change upon the way when that I rid upon was tired.\n         </tei-p>\n         <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            From <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Buenos Ayres</tei-placeName>, to the <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">River Lucan</tei-placeName>, and even as far as the <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">River \n            Recife</tei-placeName>, 30 Leagues, I pass’d by several Habitations and Farms cultivated \n            by the Spaniards, but beyond <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Recife</tei-placeName> to the <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">River Salladillo</tei-placeName>, I saw none. \n            Let it be observed by the way, that these Rivers as well as all the rest \n            in the Provinces of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Buenos Ayres</tei-placeName>, <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Paraguay</tei-placeName> and <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Tucuman</tei-placeName>, that fall into the \n            River de la Plata are fordable on Horse-back; but when the Rains or any \n            other accident swells them, a Traveller must either swim over, or else get \n            upon a bundle in the nature of a raft, which a Savage hawls over to the \n            other side. I could not Swim, and so was forc'd to make use of this \n            expedient twice or thrice when I could not find a Ford. The way was this, \n            my Indian kill'd a Wild Bull, flead the Hide off, stuffed it with straw, \n            and ty'd it up in a great bundle with thongs of the same Hide, upon which \n            I plac'd my self with my Baggage ; he swam over hawling me after him by a \n            Cord ty'd to the bundle, and then he repass'd and swam my Horses and Mules \n            over to me.\n         </tei-p>\n         <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            All the Country between the <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">River Recife</tei-placeName> and <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Salladillo</tei-placeName>, tho' uninhabited, \n            abounds in Cattle and all sorts of Fruit trees, except Walnut and Chesnut-\n            trees; there are whole Woods of Nectarine-Trees, Three or Four Leagues in \n            compass, that bear excellent Fruit, which they not only eat raw, but bake \n            them, or dry them in the Sun, to keep, as we in France do Prunes: They \n            seldom use any other than the Wood of this Tree for common firing at \n            Buenos Ayres, and thereabouts. The Savages that dwell in these Parts are \n            distinguish'd into two sorts, those that voluntarily submit to the \n            Spaniards are call’d Panpistas, the rest Serranos, both cloathed with \n            Skins, but the last set up on the Panpistas as their mortal Enemies \n            wherever they meet with them. All Fight on Horse-back, either with Lances \n            pointed with Iron or Bones sharpen'd, or else with Bows and Arrows, they \n            wear Bulls-hides fashion'd like a Doublet without sleeves, to defend their \n            Bodies. Their Chiefs that command over them in War and Peace, are call’d \n            Couracas. When they take any one of their Enemies, alive or dead, they \n            meet all together, and after they have reproach'd him, that either he or \n            his Relations were the death of their Kindred or Friends, they cut and \n            tear him into pieces, which they roast a little and eat, making a drinking \n            Bowl of his Scull. They feed mostly upon flesh either raw or dress'd, and \n            particularly Colts flesh, which they like! better than Veal. They catch \n            abundance of Fish likewise in their Rivers, They have no settled places of \n            aboad, but ramble up and down, several Families together, and live in Tents.\n         </tei-p>\n         <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            I could not inform my self exactly what Religion they were of, but I was \n            told that they look'd upon the Sun and Moon as Deities and as I travell'd \n            along, I saw a Savage upon his knees with his Face to the Sun, who cry'd \n            out and made strange gestures with his Hands and Arms. I learn'd from the \n            Savage that accompany'd me, that he was one of those they call'd Papas, \n            who in the Morning kneel towards the Sun, and at Night towards the Moon, \n            to supplicate those fancy'd Divinities to be propitious to them, to give \n            them fair Weather, and Victory over their Foes.\n         </tei-p>\n         <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            They make no great Ceremony in their Marriages ; but when a Relation dies, \n            after they have rubb’d his body with a certain Earth that consumes all but \n            the Bones, they preserve them, and carry as many of them as they can \n            conveniently about with them in a sort of Chests, and this they do in \n            token of their affection to their Kindred ; indeed they are not wanting in \n            good Offices to them during their Lives, nor in their Sickness and Death.\n         </tei-p>\n         <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            Along the River <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Salladillo</tei-placeName>, I took notice of a great many Parrats, or \n            Papagays, as the Spaniards call them, and certain Birds, call’d \n            Guacamayos, which are of divers Colours, and twice or thrice as big as a \n            Parrat. The River it self is full of the Fish, call'd Dorado, which is \n            very good to eat. There is also a Creature in it, whether 'tis Meat or \n            Poyson no body knows, it has Four Feet and a long Tail like a Lizard.\n         </tei-p>\n         <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            From <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Salladillo</tei-placeName> quite to <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Cordoua</tei-placeName>, you go along a very fine River, that \n            abounds with Fish, which is neither wide nor deep, for it may be forded \n            over. On the Bank of it you meet with little Plan tations every Three or \n            Four Leagues ; which are like Country Houses inhabited by Spaniards, \n            Portuguese, and the Natives, who have all the necessary accomodations of \n            Life they can wish, and are very Civil and Charitable to Strangers; their \n            principal Wealth is in Horses and Mules, in which they Trade with the \n            Inhabitants of Peru.\n         </tei-p>\n         <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Cordoua</tei-placeName> is a Town Situate in a pleasant and fruitful Plain upon the side \n            of a River, bigger and broader than that I have just spoken of : 'Tis \n            compos’d of about 400 Houses, Built like those of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Buenos Ayres</tei-placeName>. It has \n            neither Ditches, nor Walls, nor Fort for its defence; He that Commands it \n            is Governor of all the Provinces of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Tucuman</tei-placeName>, and tho’ it be the place of \n            his ordinary Residence, yet he is wont now and then, as he sees occasion, \n            to go and pass some time at <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">St. Jago de l’Estro</tei-placeName>, at <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">St. Miguel de Tucuman</tei-placeName>, \n            (which is the Capital City of the Province) at <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Salta</tei-placeName> and at <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Xuxui</tei-placeName>. In each \n            of these Villages there is a Lieutenant, who has under him an Alcalde and \n            some Officers for the Administration of Justice. The Bishop of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Tucuman</tei-placeName> \n            likewise usually resides at <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Cordoua</tei-placeName>, where the Cathedral is the only \n            Parish Church of the whole Town, but there are divers Convents of Monks, \n            namely of Dominicans, Recollects, and those of the Order de la Mercy: and \n            one of Nunns. The Jesuits have a College there, and their Chappel is the \n            finest and richest of all.\n         </tei-p>\n         <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            The Inhabitants are Rich in Gold and Silver, which they get by the Trade \n            they have for Mules, with which they furnish <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Peru</tei-placeName> and other Parts; which \n            is so considerable, that they sell about 28 or 30000 of 'em every Year, \n            which they breed up in their Farms. They usually keep 'em till they are \n            about Two Years old, then expose 'em to Sale, and have about Six Patagons \n            a piece for 'em. The Merchants that come to buy 'em, carry 'em to <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">St. \n            Jago</tei-placeName>, to <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Salta</tei-placeName> and <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Xuxui</tei-placeName> , where they leave 'em for Three Years, till they \n            are well grown and become strong, and afterwards bring 'em to <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Peru</tei-placeName>, where \n            they presently have Vent for 'em, because there as well as in the rest of \n            the Western part of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">America</tei-placeName>, the greatest part of their Carriage is upon \n            Mules. The People of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Cordoua</tei-placeName> also drive a Trade in Cows, which they have \n            from the Countrey of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Buenos Ayres</tei-placeName>, and carry to <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Peru</tei-placeName>, where without this \n            way of Subsistance 'tis certain they would have much ado to live. This \n            kind of Traffick makes this Town the most considerable in the Province of \n            <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Tucuman</tei-placeName>, as well for its Riches and Commodities, as for the Number of its \n            Inhabitants, which are counted to be at least 5 or 600 Families, besides \n            Slaves who are three times the number. But the gene rality of 'em of all \n            degrees have no other Arms but a Sword and Poignard, and are very \n            indifferent Souldiers, the Air of the Country, and the Plenty they enjoy, \n            rendring them Lazy and Cowardly.\n         </tei-p>\n     </tei-div>\n     </tei-body>\n </tei-text>\n</tei-TEI>","elements":["tei-TEI","tei-teiHeader","tei-fileDesc","tei-titleStmt","tei-title","tei-publicationStmt","tei-p","tei-sourceDesc","tei-text","tei-body","tei-pb","tei-head","tei-name","tei-placeName","tei-div","tei-fw"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["3064831728"]}
