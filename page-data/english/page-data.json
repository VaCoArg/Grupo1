'Tis a little place containing 25 Houſes, without any Walls, Fortifications, or Garriſon, diſtant 80 Leagues from <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\"><tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">Buenos Ayres</tei-corr></tei-placeName> Northward, Situate upon the <tei-geogFeat data-origname=\"geogFeat\">River</tei-geogFeat> <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">de la Plata</tei-placeName>, large Veſſels might come up to it, were it not for a great bank that obstructs the passage a little above <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\"><tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">Buenos Ayres</tei-corr></tei-placeName>. Nevertheleſs 'tis a very advantageous Poſt, because 'tis the only passage from <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\"><tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">Peru</tei-corr></tei-placeName>, <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Chili</tei-placeName> and <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\"><tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">Tucuman</tei-corr></tei-placeName> to Paraguay, and in a manner the Magazine of the Commodities drawn from thence, particularly that Herb already ſpoken of, which they cannot be without in thoſe Provinces. The Soil is as good and Fertile here as at <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\"><tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">Buenos Ayres</tei-corr></tei-placeName>; and the Town having nothing remarkably different from what has been observ'd of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\"><tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">Buenos Ayres</tei-corr></tei-placeName>, I leave it, and proceed upon my Journey. 'Tis counted 140 Leagues from <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\"><tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">Buenos Ayres</tei-corr></tei-placeName> to <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\"><tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">Cordoua</tei-corr></tei-placeName>, and becauſe ſome parts of the Road are uninhabited for a long way together; I ſurnished my ſelf at my departure with what I was inform'd I ſhould ſtand in need of; ſo I ſet out having a Savage for my Guide, with Three Horſes and Three Mules, ſome to carry my Baggage, and the reſt to change upon the way when that I rid upon was tired. \nFrom <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Buenos Ayres</tei-placeName>, to the <tei-geogName data-origname=\"geogName\"> <tei-geogFeat data-origname=\"geogFeat\">River Lucan</tei-geogFeat></tei-geogName><tei-ref target=\"#note1\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">(1)</tei-ref> , and even as far as the <tei-geogName data-origname=\"geogName\"> <tei-geogFeat data-origname=\"geogFeat\">River Recife </tei-geogFeat></tei-geogName><tei-ref target=\"#note2\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">(2)</tei-ref>, <tei-num type=\"cardinal\" data-origname=\"num\" data-origatts=\"type\">30</tei-num> Leagues, I pass’d by several Habitations and Farms cultivated by the Spaniards, but beyond <tei-geogName data-origname=\"geogName\"><tei-geogFeat data-origname=\"geogFeat\">Recife to the River Salladillo</tei-geogFeat></tei-geogName>, I ſaw none. Let it be obſerved by the way, that theſe <tei-geogFeat data-origname=\"geogFeat\">Rivers</tei-geogFeat> as well as all the reſt in the Provinces of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\"><tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">Buenos Ayres</tei-corr></tei-placeName>, <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Paraguay</tei-placeName> and <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\"><tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">Tucuman</tei-corr></tei-placeName>, that fall into the <tei-geogName data-origname=\"geogName\"><tei-geogFeat data-origname=\"geogFeat\">River de la Plata</tei-geogFeat></tei-geogName> are fordable on Horſe-back; but when the Rains or any other accident ſwells them, a Traveller muſt either ſwim over, or elſe get upon a bundle in the nature of a raft, which a Savage hawls over to the other ſide. I could not Swim, and ſo was forc'd to make uſe of this expedient twice or thrice when I could not find a Ford. The way was this, my Indian kill'd a Wild Bull, flead the Hide off, ſtuffed it with ſtraw, and ty'd it up in a great bundle with thongs of the ſame Hide, upon which I plac'd my ſelf with my Baggage ; he ſwam over hawling me after him by a Cord ty'd to the bundle, and then he repaſs'd and ſwam my Horſes and Mules over to me.\nAll the Country between the <tei-geogName data-origname=\"geogName\"><tei-geogFeat data-origname=\"geogFeat\">River Recife and Salladillo</tei-geogFeat></tei-geogName>, tho' uninhabited, abounds in Cattle and all ſorts of Fruit trees, except Walnut and Chesnut-trees; there are whole Woods of Nectarine-Trees, Three or Four Leagues in compaſs, that bear excellent Fruit, which they not only eat raw, but bake them, or dry them in the Sun, to keep, as we in France do Prunes: They ſeldom uſe any other than the Wood of this Tree for common firing at <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Buenos Ayres</tei-placeName>, and thereabouts. The Savages that dwell in theſe Parts are diſtinguiſh'd into two sorts, those that voluntarily ſubmit to the Spaniards are call’d <tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">Panpiſtas</tei-corr><tei-ref target=\"#note3\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">(3)</tei-ref>, the reſt Serranos, both cloathed with Skins, but the laſt ſet up on the <tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">Panpiſtas</tei-corr> as their mortal Enemies wherever they meet with them. All Fight on Horſe-back, either with Lances pointed with Iron or Bones ſharpen'd, or else with Bows and Arrows, they wear Bulls-hides faſhion'd like a Doublet without ſleeves, to defend their Bodies. Their Chiefs that command over them in War and Peace, are call’d Couracas. When they take any one of their Enemies, alive or dead, they meet all together, and after they have reproach'd him, that either he or his Relations were the death of their Kindred or Friends, they cut and tear him into pieces, which they roaſt a little and eat, making a drinking Bowl of his Scull. They feed moſtly upon flesh either raw or dreſs'd, and particularly Colts fleſh, which they like! better than Veal. They catch abundance of Fiſh likewiſe in their Rivers, They have no ſettled places of aboad, but ramble up and down, ſeveral Families together, and live in Tents. \nI could not inform my ſelf exactly what Religion they were of, but I was told that they look'd upon the Sun and Moon as Deities and as I travell'd along, I ſaw a Savage upon his knees with his Face to the Sun, who cry'd out and made ſtrange geſtures with his Hands and Arms. I learn'd from the Savage that accompany'd me, that he was one of thoſe they call'd Papas, who in the Morning kneel towards the Sun, and at Night towards the Moon, to ſupplicate those fancy'd Divinities to be propitious to them, to give them fair Weather, and Victory over their Foes. \nThey make no great Ceremony in their Marriages ; but when a Relation dies, after they have rubb’d his body with a certain Earth that conſumes all but the Bones, they preserve them, and carry as many of them as they can conveniently about with them in a ſort of Cheſts, and this they do in token of their affection to their Kindred ; indeed they are not wanting in good Offices to them during their Lives, nor in their Sickneſs and Death. \nAlong the <tei-geogName data-origname=\"geogName\"><tei-geogFeat data-origname=\"geogFeat\">River Salladillo</tei-geogFeat></tei-geogName>, I took notice of a great many <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Parrats</tei-emph>, or <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Papagays</tei-emph>, as the Spaniards call them, and certain Birds, call’d <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Guacamayos</tei-emph>, which are of divers Colours, and twice or thrice as big as a <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Parrat</tei-emph>. The River it ſelf is full of the Fiſh, call'd <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Dorado</tei-emph>, which is very good to eat. There is alſo a Creature in it, whether 'tis Meat or Poyſon no body knows, it has Four Feet and a long Tail like a Lizard. \nFrom <tei-geogName data-origname=\"geogName\"><tei-geogFeat data-origname=\"geogFeat\">Salladillo</tei-geogFeat></tei-geogName> quite to <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\"><tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">Cordoua</tei-corr></tei-placeName>, you go along a very fine <tei-geogFeat data-origname=\"geogFeat\">River</tei-geogFeat>, that abounds with Fiſh, which is neither wide nor deep, for it may be forded over. On the Bank of it you meet with little Plan tations every Three or Four Leagues ; which are like Country Houſes inhabited by Spaniards, Portuguese, and the Natives, who have all the neceſſary accomodations of Life they can wiſh, and are very Civil and Charitable to Strangers; their principal Wealth is in Horſes and Mules, in which they Trade with the Inhabitants of Peru. \n<tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Cordoua</tei-placeName> is a Town Situate in a pleaſant and fruitful Plain upon the ſide of a River, bigger and broader than that I have juſt ſpoken of : 'Tis compos’d of about  <tei-num type=\"cardinal\" data-origname=\"num\" data-origatts=\"type\">400</tei-num> Houses, Built like thoſe of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\"><tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">Buenos Ayres</tei-corr></tei-placeName>. It has neither Ditches, nor Walls, nor Fort for its defence; He that Commands it is <tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">Governor</tei-roleName> of all the Provinces of Tucuman, and tho’ it be the place of his ordinary Residence, yet he is wont now and then, as he ſees occaſion, to go and paſs ſome time at <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\"><tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">St. Jago de l’Eſtro</tei-corr></tei-placeName><tei-ref target=\"#note4\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">(4)</tei-ref>, at <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">St. Miguel de Tucuman</tei-placeName>, (which is the Capital City of the Province) at <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Salta</tei-placeName> and at <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\"><tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">Xuxui</tei-corr></tei-placeName><tei-ref target=\"#note5\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">(5)</tei-ref>. In each of theſe Villages there is a Lieutenant, who has under him an <tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">Alcalde</tei-roleName> and <tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">ſome Officers</tei-roleName> for the Adminiſtration of Juſtice. The <tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">Biſhop</tei-roleName> of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Tucuman</tei-placeName> likewiſe uſually reſides at <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Cordoua</tei-placeName>, where the Cathedral is the only Pariſh Church of the whole Town, but there are divers Convents of Monks, namely of Dominicans, Recollects, and those of the Order de la Mercy: and one of Nunns. The Jesuits have a College there, and their Chappel is the fineſt and richeſt of all. \nThe Inhabitants are Rich in Gold and Silver, which they get by the Trade they have for Mules, with which they furniſh Peru and other Parts; which is ſo conſiderable, that they ſell about 28 or 30000 of 'em every Year, which they breed up in their Farms. They usually keep 'em till they are about Two Years old, then expose 'em to Sale, and have about Six Patagons a piece for 'em. The Merchants that come to buy 'em, carry 'em to St. Jago, to Salta and Xuxui , where they leave 'em for Three Years, till they are well grown and become ſtrong, and afterwards bring 'em to Peru, where they preſently have Vent for 'em, becauſe there as well as in the reſt of the Western part of America, the greateſt part of their Carriage is upon Mules. The People of Cordoua alſo drive a Trade in Cows, which they have from the Countrey of Buenos Ayres, and carry to Peru, where without this way of Subſiſtance 'tis certain they would have much ado to live. This kind of Traffick makes this Town the moſt conſiderable in the Province of Tucuman, as well for its Riches and Commodities, as for the Number of its Inhabitants, which are counted to be at leaſt  <tei-num type=\"cardinal\" data-origname=\"num\" data-origatts=\"type\"> 5  </tei-num> or  <tei-num type=\"cardinal\" data-origname=\"num\" data-origatts=\"type\"> 600 </tei-num>Families, beſides Slaves who are three times the number. But the gene rality of 'em of all degrees have no other Arms but a Sword and Poignard, and are very indifferent Souldiers, the Air of the Country, and the Plenty they enjoy, rendring them Lazy and Cowardly. </tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-note xml:id=\"note1\" id=\"note1\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"xml:id\">1.
