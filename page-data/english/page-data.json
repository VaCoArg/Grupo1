I could not Swim, and so was forc'd to make use of this \n            expedient twice or thrice when I could not find a Ford.

All Fight on Horse-back, either with Lances \n            pointed with Iron or Bones sharpen'd, or else with Bows and Arrows, they \n            wear Bulls-hides fashion'd like a Doublet without sleeves, to defend their \n            Bodies. Their Chiefs that command over them in War and Peace, are call’d \n            Couracas. When they take any one of their Enemies, alive or dead, they \n            meet all together, and after they have reproach'd him, that either he or \n            his Relations were the death of their Kindred or Friends, they cut and \n            tear him into pieces, which they roast a little and eat, making a drinking \n            Bowl of his <tei-sic data-origname=\"sic\">Scull</tei-sic><tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">Skull</tei-corr>. They feed mostly upon flesh either raw or dress'd, and \n            particularly <tei-sic data-origname=\"sic\">Colts</tei-sic><tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">Colt's</tei-corr> flesh, which they like better than Veal. They catch \n            abundance of Fish likewise in their Rivers. They have no settled places of \n            <tei-sic data-origname=\"sic\">aboad</tei-sic><tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">abode</tei-corr>, but ramble up and down, several Families together, and live in Tents.\n         </tei-p>\n         <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            I could not inform my self exactly what Religion they were of, but I was \n            told that they look'd upon the Sun and <tei-fw type=\"catch\" data-origname=\"fw\" data-origatts=\"type\">Moon</tei-fw>\n            <tei-pb n=\"28\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n            Moon as Deities and as I travell'd along, I saw a Savage upon his knees \n            with his Face to the Sun, who cry'd out and made strange gestures with \n            his Hands and Arms. I learn'd from the Savage that accompany'd me, that \n            he was one of those they call'd Papas, who in the Morning kneel towards the Sun,\n            and at Night towards the Moon, to supplicate those fancy'd Divinities \n            to be propitious to them, to give them fair Weather, and Victory over their Foes.\n         </tei-p>\n         <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            They make no great Ceremony in their Marriages ; but when a Relation dies, \n            after they have rubb’d his body with a certain Earth that consumes all but \n            the Bones, they preserve them, and carry as many of them as they can \n            conveniently about with them in a sort of Chests, and this they do in \n            token of their affection to their Kindred ; indeed they are not wanting in \n            good Offices to them during their Lives, nor in their Sickness and Death.\n         </tei-p>\n         <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            Along the River <tei-geogName data-origname=\"geogName\">Salladillo</tei-geogName>, I took notice of a great many Parrats, or \n            Papagays, as the Spaniards call them, and certain Birds, call’d \n            Guacamayos, which are of divers Colours, and twice or thrice as big as a \n            Parrat.

On the Bank of it you meet with little Plantations every Three or \n            Four Leagues ; which are like Country Houses inhabited by Spaniards, \n            Portuguese, and the Natives, who have all the necessary accomodations of \n            Life they can wish, and are very Civil and Charitable to Strangers; their \n            principal Wealth is in Horses and Mules, in which they Trade with the \n            Inhabitants of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Peru</tei-placeName>.\n         </tei-p>\n         <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Cordoua</tei-placeName> is a Town <tei-sic data-origname=\"sic\">Situate</tei-sic><tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">Situated</tei-corr>\n            in a pleasant and fruitful Plain upon the side of a River, bigger and broader than that I have just spoken of : \n            'Tis compos’d of about 400 Houses, Built like those of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Buenos Ayres</tei-placeName>.

In each \n            of these Villages there is a Lieutenant, who has under him an Alcalde and \n            some Officers for the Administration of Justice. The Bishop of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Tucuman</tei-placeName> \n            likewise usually resides at <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Cordoua</tei-placeName>, where the Cathedral is the only \n            Parish Church of the whole Town, but there are divers Convents of Monks, \n            namely of Dominicans, Recollects, and those of the Order de la Mercy: and \n            one of Nunns. The Jesuits have a College there, and their <tei-sic data-origname=\"sic\">Chappel</tei-sic><tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">Chapel</tei-corr> is the \n            finest and richest of all.\n         </tei-p>\n         <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            The Inhabitants are Rich in Gold and Silver, which they get by the Trade \n            they have for Mules, with which they furnish <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Peru</tei-placeName> and other Parts; which \n            is so considerable, that they sell about 28 or 30000 of 'em every Year, \n            which they breed up in their Farms. They usually keep 'em till they are \n            about Two Years old, then expose 'em to Sale, and have about Six Patagons \n            a piece for 'em. The Merchants that come to buy 'em, carry 'em to <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">St. \n            Jago</tei-placeName>, to <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Salta</tei-placeName> and <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Xuxui</tei-placeName>, \n            where they leave 'em for Three Years, till they are well grown and become <tei-fw type=\"catch\" data-origname=\"fw\" data-origatts=\"type\">strong,</tei-fw> \n            <tei-pb n=\"31\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n            and afterwards bring 'em to <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Peru</tei-placeName>, where \n            they presently have Vent for 'em, because there as well as in the rest of \n            the Western part of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">America</tei-placeName>, the greatest part of their Carriage is upon \n            Mules. The People of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Cordoua</tei-placeName> also drive a Trade in Cows, which they have \n            from the <tei-sic data-origname=\"sic\">Countrey</tei-sic><tei-corr data-origname=\"corr\">Country</tei-corr> of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Buenos Ayres</tei-placeName>, and carry to <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Peru</tei-placeName>, where without this \n            way of Subsistance 'tis certain they would have much ado to live.
