All ideas will be discussed together and will have the same value, without hierarchies or ranks.</li>\n        <li>We commit to always communicating, to do our best to attend the weekly virtual meetings and to answer all requests that any other member may make via our agreed forms of communication: Slack, WhatsApp and email.</li>\n        <li>We agree that, in case of internal conflicts, we will seek a solution based on tolerance and mutual respect, externalizing the problem only if we cannot solve it within the team.</li>\n        <li>We agree that all team members will receive equal credit for the project. We will perform different tasks, but we are one team, and therefore the final product will be the responsibility of each and every one of us. Likewise, the final product cannot be attributed to any individual member.</li>\n        <li>We commit to making our digital humanities project open source and Creative Commons licensed.</li>\n        <li>We commit to striving to learn all the skills that make this project possible and that occur within the framework of this course and to take advantage of all learning opportunities.</li>\n    </ol>\n</p>\n\n<h2>Ethos</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>We seek group consensus for each stage of the learning process.</li>\n    <li>We enjoy the linguistic and technical challenges of the collaborative learning process.</li>\n    <li>We encourage practicing each skill we learn in order to strengthen it.</li>\n</ul>"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3064831728","3125482578"]}
