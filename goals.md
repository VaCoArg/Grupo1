## Goals / Objetivos
As a team, we want to improve our programming skills with Visual Studio and Github and use those skills to create a digital-humanities project together. That will mean learning how to communicate well as a group, by finding ways to collaborate across continents and languages and given our differing areas of expertise. Part of that work will be recognizing each of our strengths, while also learning from one another and exploring parts of programming and digital-humanities research that we are less familiar with. We hope that the edition we create will be a useful resource for researchers and will make historical research more generally accessible.
